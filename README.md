# Note Taking Application


I built a Note App with a fluid user interface using Facebook's JavaScript library, React.


The front-end React Application, which consists of assets such as images, CSS, and JavaScript code. The back-end Rails API, which renders JSON and interacts with the front-end.


The Note App performed AJAX requests, especially using the Axios library.

I add note functionalities such as this app is set up to trigger custom code when the button to edit note is pressed. I ensured the proper note loads into the state of the application.

I also add the ability to create, show, update and remove tags on a note. Then, I set up flash notifications that alert the user when validation errors happen.
